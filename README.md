# PCA-and-PLS-PM
The PCA technique is amongst the powerful dimension reduction techniques before the downstream analysis. Even though the PLS-PM has a similar capability, 
PLS-PM is a supervised machine learning for PCA. The project has brewed the two dimensions reduction into single platforms to get a glimpse about the indicators variability. 
The main concern was to test for the potential observed heterogeneity. Therefore, It was crucial to compare the structural and measurement model to detect heterogeneity.
That said, this project is a series of steps that include exploratory data analysis, multi-group analysis, groups validations, and PLS-PM segmentations tree through Pathmox-PLS.    
#This project has five-phase of analysis 
1. The project starts with the PCA to visualize the dimensions of the predictors implicitly to sample size
2. The second phase, the project has used the exploratory technique such as the k-means clustering technique to visualize the anomaly from the data set
3. Afterwards, the project has created the multi-group analysis, it set out the experience as segment variable (HIGH and LOW) 
4. The project has to pick each above group into a separate model. Researchers  have framed it as the ‘observed heterogeneity’ in PLS-PM
5. The fifth phase, the project compared the two groups using the permutations and bootstrap tests. It is a robust method for groups validations
6. To check the validity and to what extent  it was critical to distill the multi-group analysis above, the project executed the novel segmentation tree technique (Pathmox-PLS)
7. The Pathmox-PLS is similar to CART. Leo Breiman invented the later methods in regressions and former orchestrated by Sanchez. Afterward, Lamberti extended it;
   at this stage the objective is not to make a prediction but verifications.
